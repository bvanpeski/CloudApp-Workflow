Alfred Extensions | CloudApp Direct Link Workflow
===============


##CloudApp Direct Link Workflow##
For those that prefer to use [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com/) instead of Skitch or other screen captuire programs, this workflow allows you to copy the direct link for a file uploaded to cloudapp. I designed this specifically for quickly throwing images into IRC which, if you want to drop an image in-line, will only detect urls ending with an image extension.

You'll need a [PowerPack license](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) in order to install extensions.

# Installation

To install the CloudApp workflow, double click on ```CloudApp_DirectLink.alfredworkflow``` or drag the workflow to the workflow window in Alfred.

Open Alfred Prefs (Cmd + ,) and go to the **Workflow** tab to confirm the installation

# How to use

If you have recently auto-uploaded a screenshot or manually dragged an image into the cloud.ly menu bar, type ```cl``` into Alfred after the file has completed uploading. Hit **Enter** to copy the direct link to that image or file to your clipboad and paste wherever you desire (Cmd + v).
